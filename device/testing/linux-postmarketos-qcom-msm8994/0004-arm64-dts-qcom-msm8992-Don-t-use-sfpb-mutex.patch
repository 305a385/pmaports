Subject: [PATCH 4/4] arm64: dts: qcom: msm8992: Don't use sfpb mutex

MSM8992 uses the same mutex hardware as MSM8994. This was wrong
from the start, but never presented as an issue until the sfpb
compatible was given different driver data.

Fixes: 6a6d1978f9c0 ("arm64: dts: msm8992 SoC and LG Bullhead (Nexus 5X) support")
Reported-by: Eugene Lepshy <fekz115@gmail.com>
